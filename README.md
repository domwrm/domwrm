# Hi, I'm Dom ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a fourth-year Computer Science student at UC San Diego with a passion for software development. My interest in technology began with video games, which sparked a curiosity about how software can shape engaging experiences and connect people in meaningful ways. Over time, that curiosity has grown into a focus on building applications that are impactful and enjoyable to use through research, open source, and personal projects.

Outside of creating here are some other things I love: Competitive Gaming - Attending Concerts - Finding Food Spots - Pickleball - Day Trips
